# Boids Simulation – Adaptive Flocking Behavior

This project simulates adaptive flocking behavior using the Boids model, inspired by the seminal work of Craig Reynolds. It includes enhancements such as dynamic neighborhood perception, obstacle avoidance, short-range repulsion, and genetic algorithm optimization.

## Features

- 🧠 Adaptive flocking rules: separation, alignment, cohesion
- 🚧 Obstacle avoidance using vector repulsion
- 🔁 Dynamic perception radius based on surroundings
- 🧬 Genetic algorithm (via DEAP) for behavior optimization
- 🎮 Interactive Pygame interface to tweak parameters live

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `pygame`
- `deap` (for genetic algorithm)

### Installation

```bash
pip install pygame deap
