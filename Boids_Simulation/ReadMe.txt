Shift + Left Click to add obstaclesr

To run the simulation, execute the main.py file after installing the required libraries. Use the provided controls to interact with the simulation and adjust various parameters.
The simulation includes the following features:

Adjustable number of boids
Customizable behavior weights for separation, alignment, and cohesion
Toggle for enabling/disabling each behavior
Obstacle avoidance for boids (with the ability to add obstacles by Shift + Left Click)
Trace lines showing the path of each boid
Perception circle indicating the perception radius of each boid
Adjustable perception radius (scale) for boids
Interactive user interface (UI) for controlling simulation parameters
Evolutionary algorithm (EA) for optimizing the behavior weights
